# WaTEM_SEDEM_dynamic_EU
The code respository for a multitemporal implementation of the WaTEM/SEDEM soil erosion and sediment delivery model. The relevant modules are contained to: 1) run the preprocessing of all model input layers from EU data sources to undertake catchment-scale modelling, 2) run WaTEM/SEDEM in a multitemporal format and perform several types (temporally-lumped and temporally-dynamic (15-day)) calibration using different optimisation routines. In both calibration routines, the model is integrated within the scipy.optimise functionality to undertake an efficient external optimisation scheme, independent of the internal WaTEM/SEDEM calibration routine. WaTEM/SEDEM is therefore launched via a Python wrapper which can be found in the module (cnws). The module is very slightly modified for this use case, however full credit for the code should be given to Fluves and the Flemish Government (the full github page can be found here: https://github.com/watem-sedem/pywatemsedem?tab=readme-ov-file). 

The repository contains two main scripts:
1) WaTEM_SEDEM_PREPROCESSING_1: the script to undertake the (geo)processing for the multitemporal and static input layers.
2) WaTEM_SEDEM_IMPLEMENTATION_2: the script to launch multitemporal simulations using the WaTEM/SEDEM model as well as run the calibration routine and merge the simulations with catchment observations from the EUSEDcollab repository (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02393-8).

The relevant data to run examples of each routine can be found at:https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/WaTEM_SEDEM_dynamic_EU/24299311
